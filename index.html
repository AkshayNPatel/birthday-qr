    <h1>Happy Birthday Ms.Hetal Chudasama </h1>
    <p>
  I cannot recall the exact moment when you shifted from being ‘someone I know’
to becoming the quiet presence that lives gently in my thoughts.
But I do know this  my days feel softer, lighter, and brighter
whenever you appear in them.
</p>
<p>
  On your 29th birthday, I wish for you a day as warm, kind, and unexpectedly magical as you are,
  You may think of yourself as simple, but to me, that simplicity is rare and beautiful.
  Every moment you appear in my world softens the day, turning ordinary hours into something unforgettable.
</p>
<p>
  I don’t know where life will take us, but I do know this: having you in my
  world, even from a little distance, already feels like a wonderful gift.
  I hope this small page makes you smile, the way you so often make me smile.
</p>
    <p><b>Enjoy your special day 🎉</b></p>
 <h1>Hey, we have been talking for a while and, I think i like you I would really like to get to know you better so, can i take you out for date!</h1>
